# ML-SpaceX-Falcon-9
Overview
This project aims to predict the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets using machine learning techniques. The goal is to determine whether a Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully based on various features related to the launch and landing conditions.

Repository Structure
spacex-falcon-9-landing-prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the prediction model.
Key Components
Data Exploration:

The dataset used for this project contains information about Falcon 9 rocket launches, including features such as the flight number, rocket type, landing pad, and mission outcome.
The code performs initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and content, including summary statistics and visualizations.
Data Preprocessing:

Missing values and categorical variables are handled to prepare the data for modeling.
Features are selected and transformed to improve the model's performance.
Feature Engineering:

New features are created based on existing data to enhance the model's ability to make accurate predictions.
Feature scaling and normalization are applied to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.
Model Building:

Various machine learning models are implemented to predict the landing success of Falcon 9 rockets. This includes algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
The models are trained using historical data and evaluated based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation:

The performance of each model is assessed using validation techniques such as cross-validation.
Metrics are compared to select the best-performing model for predicting landing success.
Results and Conclusion:

The results of the model predictions are analyzed, and insights are drawn regarding the factors influencing landing success.
The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings and potential areas for future work.
